This paper reports on an initial and nec-
essary step toward the construction of a
Pan-Chinese lexical resource. We inves-
tigated the regional variation of lexical
items in two specific domains, finance
and sports; and explored how much of
such variation is covered in existing Chi-
nese synonym dictionaries, in particular
the Tongyici Cilin. The domain-specific
lexical items were obtained from subsec-
tions of a synchronous Chinese corpus,
LIVAC. Results showed that 20-40% of
the words from various subcorpora are
unique to the individual communities,
and as much as 70% of such unique items
are not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin.
The results suggested great potential for
building a Pan-Chinese lexical resource
for Chinese language processing. Our
next step would be to explore automatic
means for extracting related lexical items
from the corpus, and to incorporate them
into existing semantic classifications.

1 Introduction

Many cities have underground railway systems.
Somehow one takes the tube in London but the
subway in New York. In a more recent edition
of the Roget&apos;s Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987),
subway, tube, underground railway and metro
are found in the same semicolon-separated group
under head 624 Way. Similarly if one looks up
WordNet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu; Miller et
al., 1990), the synset to which subway belongs
also contains the words metro, tube, under-
ground, and subway system; and it is further in-
dicated that &amp;quot;in Paris the subway system is called
the `metro&apos; and in London it is called the `tube&apos;
or the `underground&apos;&apos;. Such regional lexical
variation is also found in Chinese. For instance,
the subway system in Hong Kong, known as the
Mass Transit Railway or MTR, is called +&apos;J0 in
Chinese. The subway systems in Beijing and
Shanghai, as well as the one in Singapore, are
also known as +&apos;J0, but that in Taipei is known
as L—PI. Their counterpart in Japan is written as
+&apos;J__k 4;zP in Kanji. Such regional variation, as part
of lexical knowledge, is important and useful for
many natural language applications, including
natural language understanding, information re-
trieval, and machine translation. Unfortunately,
existing Chinese lexical resources often lack
such comprehensiveness.
To fill this gap, Tsou and Kwong (2006) pro-
posed a comprehensive Pan-Chinese lexical re-
source, based on a large and unique synchronous
Chinese corpus as an authentic basis for lexical
acquisition and analysis across various Chinese
speech communities. For a significant world
language like Chinese, a useful lexical resource
should have maximum versatility and portability.
It is not sufficient to target at one particular
community speaking the language and thus cover
only language usage observed from that particu-
lar community. Instead, such a lexical resource
should document the core and universal sub-
stances of the language on the one hand, and also
the more subtle variations found in different
communities on the other. As is evident from the
above example on the variation of subway, re-
gional variation should be captured for the lexi-
cal resource to be useful in a wide range of ap-
plications.
In this study, we investigate and compare the
regional variation of lexical items from two spe-

cific domains, finance and sports, as an initial
and necessary step toward the more important
undertaking of building a Pan-Chinese lexical
resource. In addition, we make use of an exist-
ing Chinese synonym dictionary, the Tongyici
Cilin (Mei et al., 1984) as leverage, and explore
its coverage of such variation and thus the poten-
tial for enriching it. The lexical items under
study were obtained from a synchronous Chinese
corpus, LIVAC, which will be further introduced
in Section 4. Corpus data from four Chinese
speech communities were compared with respect
to their commonality and uniqueness, and also
against Cilin for their coverage. Results showed
that 20-40% of the words extracted from the cor-
pus are unique to the individual communities,
and as much as 70% of such unique items are not
yet covered in Cilin. It therefore suggests that
the synchronous corpus is a rich source for
mining region-specific lexical items, and there is
great potential for building a Pan-Chinese lexical
resource for Chinese language processing.
In Section 2, we will briefly review existing
resources and related work. Then in Section 3,
we will briefly outline the design and architec-
ture of the Pan-Chinese lexical resource pro-
posed by Tsou and Kwong (2006). In Section 4,
we will further describe the Chinese synonym
dictionary and the synchronous Chinese corpus
used in this study. The comparison of their lexi-
cal items will be discussed in Section 5. Future
directions will be presented in Section 6, fol-
lowed by a conclusion.

2 Existing Resources and Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993534657142858">
The construction and development of large
lexical resources is relying more and more on
corpus-based approaches, not only as a result of
the increased availability of large corpora, but
also for the authoritativeness and authenticity
allowed by the approach. The Collins
COBUILD English Dictionary (Sinclair, 1987) is
amongst the most well-known lexicographic fruit
based on large corpora.
For natural language applications, much of the
information in conventional dictionaries targeted
at human readers must be made explicit. Lexical
resources for computer use thus need consider-
able manipulation, customisation, and supple-
mentation (e.g. Calzolari, 1982). WordNet
(Miller et al., 1990), grouping words into synsets
and linking them up with relational pointers, is
probably the first broad coverage general compu-
tational lexical database. In view of the intensive
time and effort required in resource building,
some researchers have taken an alternative route
by extracting information from existing machine-
readable dictionaries and corpora semi-
automatically (e.g. Vossen et al., 1989; Riloff
and Shepherd, 1999; Lin et al, 2003).
Compared to the development of thesauri and
lexical databases, and research into semantic
networks for major languages such as English,
similar work for the Chinese language is less
mature. This gap was partly due to the lack of
authoritative Chinese corpora as a basis for
analysis, but has been gradually reduced with the
recent availability of large Chinese corpora in-
cluding the LIVAC synchronous corpus (Tsou
and Lai, 2003) used in this work and further de-
scribed below, the Sinica Corpus (Chen et al.,
1996), the Chinese Penn Treebank (Xia et al.,
2000), and the like.
An important issue which is seldom addressed
in the construction of Chinese lexical databases
is the problem of versatility and portability. For
a language such as Chinese which is spoken in
many different communities, different linguistic
norms have emerged as a result of the individual-
istic evolution and development of the language
within a particular community and culture. Such
variations are seldom adequately reflected in ex-
isting lexical resources, which often only draw
reference from one particular source. For in-
stance, Tongyici Cilin(�����) (Mei et al.,
1984) is a thesaurus containing some 70,000
Chinese lexical items in the tradition of the Ro-
get&apos;s Thesaurus for English, that is, in a hierar-
chy of broad conceptual categories. First pub-
lished in the 1980s, it was based exclusively on
Chinese as used in post-1949 Mainland China.
Thus for the subway example above, the closest
word group found is &apos; F 41 , 1741 (train) only, let
alone the subway itself and its regional variations.
With the recent availability of large corpora,
especially synchronous ones, to construct an au-
thoritative and timely lexical resource for Chi-
nese is less distant than it was in the past. A
large synchronous corpus provides authentic ex-
amples of the language as used in a variety of
locations. It thus enables us to attempt a com-
prehensive and in-depth analysis of the core
common language in constructing a lexical re-
source; and to incorporate useful information
relating to location-sensitive linguistic variations.

3 Proposal of a Pan-Chinese Thesaurus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998192413793103">
The Pan-Chinese lexicon proposed by Tsou and
Kwong (2006) is expected to capture not only the
core senses of lexical items but also senses and
uses specific to individual Chinese speech
communities.
The lexical database will be organised into a
core database and a supplementary one. The
core database will contain the core lexical infor-
mation for word senses and usages which are
common to most Chinese speech communities,
whereas the supplementary database will contain
the language uses specific to individual commu-
nities, including &amp;quot;marginal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sublanguage&amp;quot;
uses.
A network structure will be adopted for the
lexical items. The nodes could be sets of near-
synonyms or single lexical items (in which case
synonymy will be one type of links). The links
will not only represent the paradigmatic semantic
relations but also syntagmatic ones (such as se-
lectional restrictions).
We thus begin by investigating in depth the
regional variation of lexical items, especially
domain-specific words, among several Chinese
speech communities. In addition, we explore the
potential of enriching existing resources as a start.
In the following section, we will discuss the
Tongyici Cilin and the synchronous Chinese cor-
pus used in this study in greater details.

4.1 The Tongyici Cilin
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.939778">
The Tongyici Cilin(同義詞詞林) (Mei et al.,
1984) is a Chinese synonym dictionary, or more
often known as a Chinese thesaurus in the tradi-
tion of the Roget&apos;s Thesaurus for English. The
Roget&apos;s Thesaurus has about 1,000 numbered
semantic heads, more generally grouped under
higher level semantic classes and subclasses, and
more specifically differentiated into paragraphs
and semicolon-separated word groups. Similarly,
some 70,000 Chinese lexical items are organized
into a hierarchy of broad conceptual categories in
the Tongyici Cilin. Its classification consists of

4.2 The LIVAC Synchronous Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.91217390625">
LIVAC (http://www.livac.org) stands for Lin-
guistic Variation in Chinese Speech Communi-
ties. It is a synchronous corpus developed by the
Language Information Sciences Research Centre
of the City University of Hong Kong since 1995
(Tsou and Lai, 2003). The corpus consists of
newspaper articles collected regularly and syn-
chronously from six Chinese speech communi-
ties, namely Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei, Singa-
pore, Shanghai, and Macau. Texts collected
cover a variety of domains, including front page
news stories, local news, international news, edi-
torials, sports news, entertainment news, and fi-
nancial news. Up to December 2005, the corpus
has already accumulated about 180 million char-
acter tokens which, upon automatic word seg-
mentation and manual verification, amount to
over 900K word types.
For the present study, we make use of the sub-
corpora collected over the 9-year period 1995-
2004 from Hong Kong (HK), Beijing (BJ),
Taipei (TW), and Singapore (SG). In particular,
we focus on the financial news and sports news
to investigate the commonality and uniqueness of
the lexical items used in these specific domains
in the various communities. We also evaluate
the adequacy of the Tongyici Cilin in terms of its
coverage of such domain-specific terms espe-
cially from the Pan-Chinese perspective, and
thus assess the room for its enrichment with the
synchronous corpus. Table 1 shows the sizes of
the subcorpora used for this study.

5.1 Lexical Items from LIVAC
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998458833333333">
The four subcorpora of the financial domain
differ considerably in their sizes, and slightly less
so for the sports domain. Despite this, we ob-
served for both domains from Tables 2 and 3 that
in general about 40-50% of all word types are
numbers, non-Chinese words, proper names, and
function words. Of the remaining items, about
20-30% have frequency greater than 5. These
several thousand word types from each subcor-
pus are expected to be amongst the more interest-
ing items and form the &amp;quot;candidate sets&amp;quot; for fur-
ther investigation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999436">
5.2 Commonality among Various Regions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998837695652174">
Comparing the candidate sets from various sub-
corpora, which reflect the use of Chinese in vari-
ous Chinese speech communities, Tables 4 and 5
show the sizes of the intersection sets among
different places for the two domains respectively.
The intersection set for all four places contains
slightly more than 1,000 lexical items in the fi-
nancial domain. A quick skim through these
common lexical items suggests that they contain,
on the one hand, the many general concepts in
the financial domain (e.g. FlJ company, VA
market, �,KLi7 bank, JOV:r invest / investment, �
�business, gW develop / development, PRI
corporation, J!U f,j stock shares, J!U4 shareholder,
V:r�capital, etc.); and on the other hand, many
reportage and cognitive verbs often used in news
articles (e.g. i, express, � d reckon, &lt;&lt; , ,!
appear, &apos;--M reflect, etc.).
In the sports domain, more than 1,700 lexical
items were found in all of the four subcorpora.
Like its financial counterpart, we found many
general concepts at the top of the list (e.g. 5N _J
player, 5N�team,rjf match, r competi-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994506">

<bodyText confidence="0.986493129032258">
tion, r league, &amp;quot; t coach, W opponent,
ice&apos;#i champion, etc.).
The numbers of overlaps in Tables 4 suggest
that lexical items used in Mainland China (as
evident from BJ data) seem to have the least in
common with the rest. For instance, compared to
the overlap amongst all four regions (i.e. 1,039),
the overlap has increased most when BJ was not
included in the comparison; and when we com-
pare any two regions, the overlap between BJ
and TW is smallest. Nevertheless, such unique-
ness of BJ data is less apparent in the sports do-
main. In particular, the difference between
HK/BJ and BJ/TW is even slightly less than that
in the financial domain.
If we look at the individual regions, HK ap-
parently shares most (about 50%) with SG, and
vice versa (about 68%), in the financial domain.
At the same time, BJ also shares more with HK
than with the other two regions, and so does TW.
But surprisingly, BJ has over 60% overlap with
SG and about 55% with TW in the sports domain.
The overlaps of TW with HK and with BJ differ
by more than 20% in the finance domain, but
only by about 10% in the sports domain. All
these patterns might suggest lexical items in the
financial domain are more versatile and have
more varied focus in different communities,
whereas those in the sports domain reflect the
more common interests of different places.

5.3 Uniqueness of Various Regions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999596444444445">
Next we compared the lists with respect to what
they have unique to themselves. Table 6 shows
the numbers of unique items found in each list,
together with examples from the most frequent
20 unique items in each case.
Again, taking the size difference among the
candidate sets into account, about 40% of the
lexical items found in HK data are unique to the
region, which re-echoes the versatility and wide

<bodyText confidence="0.989710766666667">
coverage of interests of HK data. This is espe-
cially evident when compared to only about 20%
of the candidate sets for SG are unique to Singa-
pore.1
Looking at the unique lexical items found in
individual regions, it is not difficult to see the
region-specific lexicalisation of certain concepts.
For instance, in terms of housing, f z (housing
under the Home Ownership Scheme) is a specific
kind of housing in Hong Kong, � z is a specific
term in Singapore (as seen in SG data), whereas
housing is generally expressed as (� Y in
Mainland China (as seen in BJ data). Similarly,
�;; (HK) and &apos;_F ON &amp;quot; (BJ) both refer to training,
but may relate to different practice in the two
communities. Such regional variation lends
strong support to the importance of a Pan-
Chinese lexical resource.
The lists of unique items also suggest the vari-
ous focus and orientation in different Chinese
speech communities. For example, while Hong
Kong pays much attention to the real estate mar-
ket and stock market, Mainland China may be
focusing more on the basic needs like water,
farming, poverty alleviation, etc., and Singapore
is relatively more concerned with local affairs
like port management. The passion for baseball,
among other more popular sports like soccer, is
most obvious from the unique lexical items
found in TW data.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99878">
5.4 Comparison with Tongyici Cilin
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999591013157895">
As mentioned earlier, the Tongyici Cilin contains
some 70,000 lexical items under 12 broad se-
mantic classes, 94 subclasses, and 1,428 heads.
It was first published in the 1980s and was based
on lexical usages mostly of post-1949 Mainland
China. In this section, we discuss the results ob-
tained from comparing the unique lexical items
found from individual subcorpora with Cilin,
which are shown in Table 7.
On the one hand, Cilin&apos;s collection of words
may be considerably dated and obviously will
not include new concepts and neologisms arising
in the last two decades. On the other hand, the
data in LIVAC come from newspaper materials
in the 1990s. So overall speaking, for each of the
unique word lists, much less than 50% are cov-
ered in Cilin.
1 Upon further analysis, on average about 60% of these
&amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; items were actually found in one or more of the
other regions, but with frequency 5 or below. Since the
difference in frequency is quite large for most items, we can
reasonably treat them as unique to a particular community.
Nevertheless, there is still an apparent gap be-
tween Cilin&apos;s coverage of the unique items from
various places. About 40% of the unique items
found in BJ for both domains are covered; but
for other places, the coverage is more often less
than 30% in either or both domains. Again, this
could be considered a result of Cilin&apos;s bias to-
ward lexical usages in Mainland China.
In addition, while almost 40% of the unique
items in BJ data are found in Cilin, many of
these unique items covered are amongst the most
frequent items. On the contrary, even though
about 560 unique items in HK data are also
found in Cilin, only 3 out of the 20 most frequent
items are amongst them. In addition, the appar-
ent coverage does not necessarily suggest the
correct match of word senses. For instance, fz
is found under head Bnl together with other
items like � Y, (�=�&apos;, etc., all of which only re-
fer to the general concept of housing, instead of
the housing specifically under the Home Owner-
ship Scheme as known in Hong Kong. Also,
coverage of words like V_ ,�1�&apos; and -1—fin
the sports domain does not match their actual
usages which refer to team names. A more inter-
esting example might be &apos;F `&apos;&apos;, which is used in
the basketball context in TW data, and in no way
refers to the literal &amp;quot;hot pot&amp;quot; sense.
Results from the above comparisons thus sup-
port that (1) different Chinese speech communi-
ties have their distinct usage of Chinese lexical
items, in terms of both form and sense; (2) such
variation is found in different domains, such as
the financial and sports domain; (3) existing
lexical resources, the Tongyici Cilin in particular
as in our current study, should be enriched and
enhanced by capturing lexical usages from a va-
riety of Chinese speech communities, to repre-
sent the lexical items from a Pan-Chinese per-
spective; and (4) lexical items obtained from the
synchronous Chinese corpus can supplement the
existing content of the Tongyici Cilin, with more
contemporarily lexicalised concepts, as well as
variant expressions of similar and related con-
cepts from various Chinese speech communities.
Hence it remains for us to further investigate
how the related lexical items obtained from the
synchronous corpus should be grouped and in-
corporated into the semantic classification of ex-
isting lexical resources; and to further explore
how they might be extracted in a large scale by
automatic means. These will definitely be
amongst the most important future directions as
discussed in the next section.

In the current study, we have investigated the
regional variation of lexical items from the fi-
nancial and sports domain, and the coverage of
the Tongyici Cilin for such variation. The results
suggested great potential for building a Pan-
Chinese lexical resource for Chinese language
processing. Our next step would thus be to fur-
ther investigate more automatic means for ex-
tracting the near-synonymous or closely related
items from the various subcorpora. To this end,
we would explore algorithms like those used in
Lin et al. (2003). Of similar importance is the
mechanism for grouping the related lexical items
and incorporating them into the semantic classi-
fications of existing lexical resources. In this
regard we will proceed with further in-depth
analysis of the classificatory structures of indi-
vidual resources and fit in our Pan-Chinese ar-
chitecture.
Apart from the Tongyici Cilin, there are other
existing Chinese lexical resources such as
HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000), SUMO and
Chinese WordNet (Huang et al., 2004), as well
as other synonym dictionaries from which we
might draw reference to build up our Pan-
Chinese lexical resource.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999692947368421">
In this paper, we have investigated the regional
variation of lexical items in two specific domains
from a synchronous Chinese corpus, and ex-
plored their coverage in a Chinese synonym dic-
tionary. Results are encouraging in the sense
that 20-40% of the candidate words from various
subcorpora are unique to the individual commu-
nities, and as much as 70% of such unique items
are not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin. It
therefore suggests great importance and potential
for a Pan-Chinese lexical resource which we aim
to construct. The synchronous corpus is a valu-
able resource for mining the region-specific
expressions while existing synonym dictionaries
might provide a ready-made semantic classifica-
tory structure. Our next step would be to explore
automatic means for extracting related lexical
items from the corpus, and to incorporate them
into existing semantic classifications.
