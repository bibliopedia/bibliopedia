[0] Usage Note
=======================================
[1.1] To run for a single mode of citeExtract.pl
Usage: ./run_compare_single.sh <outDir> <outCompareFile> <suffix>
    outDir: is the output of this new run, and should be different from standard-output
    outCompareFile: contains the difference of output files in outDir with standard-output
    suffix: should be either _citations, _header, _section, _meta, or _all

E.g.: run for "_citations" mode
./run_compare_single.sh newOutput compare.citations _citations

=======================================
[1.2] To run for all modes of citeExtract.pl
Usage: ./run_compare_all.sh <outDir> <outCompareFile>
    outDir: is the output of this new run, and should be different from standard-output
    outCompareFile: contains the difference of output files in outDir with standard-output

E.g.: ./run_compare_all.sh newOutput compare
