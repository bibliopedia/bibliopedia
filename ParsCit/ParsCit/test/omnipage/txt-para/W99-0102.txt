Abstract
# Para 9 30
Accessibility of candidate referents is a crucial 
factor in successful reference assignment and 
this intuition has been adequately 
accommodated and developed in centering 
theory. By contrast, another equally important 
factor involved in reference assignment, 
namely, accessibility of contextual 
assumptions, seems to have not been 
addressed fully as a part of a computational 
theory of reference. In the field of pragmatics, 
however, the role of context has always been 
one of the central issues and the recent 
approach to context selection based on the 
notion of relevance (Sperber &amp; Wilson 
1986/1995) seems to be currently the most 
promising. In this paper, I will review and 
assess the recent centering approach to the 
interpretation of Japanese zero pronouns 
(Walker et al. 1994) as a case study, and 
suggest that relevance theory can provide one 
way of complementing it. In order to 
incorporate a needed mechanism of contextual 
selection into a model of reference assignment, 
model builders must take into account the 
hearer&apos;s ability to anticipate certain cognitive 
effects that may be achieved by upcoming 
utterances. It is my hope that this paper will 
lead to a fruitful discussion of finding possible 
ways of using Sperber &amp; Wilson&apos;s notion of 
relevance in practical applications.
# Para 39 1
1. Introduction
# Para 40 4
When a system has to assign a referent to a 
referring expression, it is almost always the 
case that there is more than one candidate 
referents and one has to resort to some way of 
# Para 44 2
eliminating the wrong candidates in order to 
choose the right one.
# Para 46 12
There are two main ways of doing this. 
First, candidate referents can be ranked on the 
basis of accessibility (Erku &amp; Gundel 1987; 
Fretheim and Gundel 1996; Gernbacher and 
Hargreaves 1988, Grosz et al. 1995; Sidner 
1983a, b; Walker et al. 1998). Alternatively, 
they can be checked against the accessibility 
of contextual assumptions (Fmcher-Kiefer 
1993; Kintsch 1988, Magliano et al. 1993; 
• McKoon &amp; Ratcliff 1992; Sanford &amp; Garrod 
1981; Sharkey &amp; Sharkey 1987; Singer 1993, 
1995).
# Para 58 5
In either case, once a candidate is singled 
out, the acceptability of the referent needs to 
be tested against some pragmatic criteria. 
Currently, we seem to have at least three 
distinct criteria available:
# Para 63 5
i. Truth-based criterion — i.e. whether the 
overall, interpretation is likely to be 
factually plausible (Clark 1977; Clark &amp; 
Haviland 1977; Erku &amp; Gundel 1987; 
Sanford &amp; Garrod 1981; Sidner 1983a);
# Para 68 6
Coherence-based criterion — i.e. whether 
the overall interpretation is likely to be 
coherent (Asher &amp; Lascaries 1993; Grosz 
et al. 1995, 1998; Hobbs 1979; Lascarides 
&amp; Asher 1993; Sanders et al. 1992; Walker 
et al. 1994,1998);
# Para 74 5
ill. Relevance-based criterion — i.e. whether 
the overall interpretation is likely to be 
optimally relevant (Matsui 1993, 1995, 
1998; Wilson 1992; Wilson &amp; Matsui 
1998).
# Para 79 1
11
# Para 80 19
In this paper, I will focus on one version of 
coherence-based criterion, namely, centering 
theory. One of the goals of centering theory is 
to sort out the various mechanisms used to 
maintain discourse coherence, and the use of 
various referring expressions is regarded as 
one such mechanism. Among the various 
hypotheses put forward by centering theory, 
what concerns us most is the following: that 
&apos;each utterance [except the initial utterance] in 
•a coherent discourse segment contains a single• 
semantic entity - the backward-looking center 
[or Cb] - that provides a link to the previous 
utterance, and an ordered set of entities - the 
forward-looking centers [or Cl] - that offer 
potential links to the next utterance &apos;(Gordon et 
al. 1993:311). There are two rules to provide 
constraints on choosing centers, which are 
shown in (1):
# Para 99 4
(1 )Rule 1: If any element of Cf (Un) is 
realised by a pronoun in Un+1 then the 
Cb (Un+1) must be realised by a 
pronoun also.
# Para 103 4
Rule 2: Sequences of continuation are 
preferred over sequences of retaining; 
and sequences of retaining are to be 
preferred over sequences of shifting.
# Para 107 9
The first rule states that the most highly 
ranked element of the forward-looking center 
of a previous utterance is the backward- 
looking center of the current utterance, and 
must be realised by a pronoun if any element 
of the Cf of the previous utterance is realised 
by a pronoun in the current utterance. The 
following example from Gordon et 4(1993), 
shown here in (2), illustrates this rule:
# Para 116 2
(2)[1]Susan gave Betsy a pet hamster. 
Cf=( Susan, Betsy, hamster 1)
# Para 118 2
[2]She reminded her such hamsters were 
quite shy.
# Para 120 3
Cb=Susan; Cf::(Susan, Betsy, hamsters) 
[3]She asked Betsy whether she liked 
the gift.
# Para 123 1
Cb=Susan; Cf=f Susan, Betsy,
# Para 124 1
gift=hamster 1)
# Para 125 2
[3 1Susan asked her whether she liked 
the gift.
# Para 127 1
Here, the first utterance has no Cb because it is
# Para 128 14
the initial sentence of a discourse. Its Cf 
includes the referents oV &apos;Susan&apos; and &apos;Betsy&apos; 
and the semantic interpretation of &apos;a hamster 
ranked in that order. The second utterance has 
Susan as the Cb and a Cf with Susan. as its 
most highly ranked element. The third 
utterance preserves the Cb and prominent Cf 
from the previous utterance, therefore it 
pronominalises the Cb successfully. By 
contrast, utterance [31, in which Susan is 
realised by a name and Betsy is realised by a 
pronoun, leads to stylistic infelicity. According 
to Gordon et al., this is due to violation of 
Rule 1 mentioned above.
# Para 142 11
The ranking of forward-looking centers is 
generally based on the discourse salience of 
each candidate entity. According to Grosz et 
al. (1995), although an ultimate criteria for 
deciding the ranking has not been worked out 
yet, there are evidences to support the idea that 
grammatical role such as SUBJECT, OBJECT, 
etc., can affect the Cf ranking. Thus, I will 
simply assume here the following preference 
in ranking forward-looking center shown in 
(3), as suggested by Grosz et al. (ibid.):
# Para 153 1
(3)SUBJECr&gt;OBJECT&gt;OTHERS
# Para 154 5
The highest ranked member of the set of 
forward-looking centers is called the 
&apos;preferred center or &apos;Cp As mentioned 
above, Cp is regarded as the most likely 
candidate for Cb in the following utterance.
# Para 159 16
Another important claim made by centering 
theory is that discourse segments are more 
coherent if they• share the same Cb. On the 
basis of this idea, different degrees of 
coherence are proposed. For example, Walker 
et al. adopt the following 4 types of transition 
between discourse segments, each 
corresponding to different degree of 
coherence, using the notion of Cb and Cp; . 
namely, &apos;continue &apos;retain&apos;, &apos;smooth-shift&apos; 
and &apos;rough-shift&apos;. These are shown in (4). 
When two utterances, say Ui-1 and U share the 
same Cb, and the same entity is also the 
highest-ranked Cf, i.e. Cp, in Ui-1, the 
transition from Ui-1 to Ui is called &apos;continue 
When Ui-1 and Ui share the same Cb, but the
# Para 175 1
12	•
# Para 176 12
same entity is not the highest-ranked Cf in Ui, 
the transition is called &apos;retain When Ui-1 and 
Ui do not share the same Cb, there are two 
possibilities: if Cb in Ui is the same as Cp in 
Ui, the transition is &apos;smooth-shift&apos;; if Cb in Ui 
is not the same as Cp in Ui, it is &apos;rough-shift 
It is claimed that when the hearer has to 
choose one from several possible 
interpretations, the one based on the most • 
coherent transition should be chosen. The 4 
transition states are ordered in the following 
way according to their preference:
# Para 188 2
(4)CONTINUE&gt;RETAIN&gt;SMOOTH-
SHIFT&gt;ROUGH-SHIFT
# Para 190 2
The second of the two rules in (1) is about this 
ordered preference of transition states.&apos;
# Para 192 2
2. Walker et al. (1994) and Japanese zero 
pronoun resolution
# Para 194 3
Walker et al. (1994) propose the following 
ranking order of forward-looking centers to 
deal with Japanese:
# Para 197 3
(5)(Grammatical or Zero) TOPIC &gt; 
EMPATHY &gt; SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT2 &gt; 
OBJECT OTHERS
# Para 200 8
As you can see, they add two new grammatical 
roles, namely, topic and empathy, to the list of 
factors affecting pronoun resolution. Since the 
notion of topic will become important in the 
discussion which follows, I will briefly 
describe the Japanese topic marker below. For 
empathy-loaded verbs, please refer to Kuno 
1987 and ICuno &amp; Kaburald 1977.
# Para 208 6
In Japanese, both in written and spoken 
discourse, NPs which can be recovered from 
context are often omitted. The omitted NPs are 
often called &apos;zero pronouns It is widely 
agreed that missing NPs in Japanese behave 
like pronouns in other languages such as
# Para 214 5
There were only three transition states in the original. 
formulation by Grosz et &apos;IL (1983, 1995), namely, 
CONTINUE. RETABV and SHIFT The distinction 
between SMOOTH-SHIFT and ROUGH-SHIFT war 
first proposed in Brennan (1987).
# Para 219 8
English. Japanese zero pronouns should be 
distinguished from missing NPs in &apos;pro-drop&apos; 
languages such as Italian, since in &apos;pro-drop&apos; 
languages, information to recover missing NPs 
is morphologically encoded elsewhere in the 
sentence, e.g. in the form of verb inflection, 
whereas Japanese lacks such an overt 
encoding.
# Para 227 9
Japanese zero pronouns are used equally 
often as inter-sentential discourse anaphors 
and intra-sentential anaphors. Here, I will 
concentrate on their use as discourse anaphors, 
where the role of context and adequate 
pragmatic criterion is crucial. For those who 
are interested in intra-sentential use of zero 
pronouns, please refer to e.g. Hasegawa 1985 
and Kameyama 1986.
# Para 236 12
In Japanese, there are several postpositional 
particles. The one we are interested in here is 
lwa which is often called a &apos;topic marker&apos;. 
As the name suggests, &apos;via&apos; is typically used to 
construct a grammatical topic of a sentence, 
which is characterised as an entity whose 
existence is preSupposed. The function of *a&apos; 
might become clearer when it is compared 
with another particle &apos;ga which marks a NP 
in the subject position, which typically 
conveys a new information. Compare (6a) and 
(6b):
# Para 248 1
(6) a. John ga hana o katta.
# Para 249 1
SUB flowers ACC bought
# Para 250 1
&apos;John bought flowers.&apos;
# Para 251 1
b. John wa hana o katta.
# Para 252 1
TOP flowers ACC bought
# Para 253 1
&apos;John bought flowers.&apos;
# Para 254 12
(6a) and (6b) share the same propositional 
content. However, only (6a) is acceptable as 
an answer to the question such as Who 
bought flowers?&apos; while only (6b) is acceptable 
as an ansvver to the question such as &apos;What did 
John buy? There are various suggestions 
about how to characterise functions of the two 
particles (see e.g. Shibatani 1990; Tanaka 
1991), and although it is an interesting 
question on its own, it shouldn &apos;t concern us 
here. This is because Walker et al. are only. 
interested in the surface form of `NP+wa&apos;,
# Para 266 1
13
# Para 267 2
which is automatically given the highest 
accessibility ranking in their framework.
# Para 269 16
Walker et al. claim that a topic NP is more 
likely to be realised as a zero pronoun in the 
subsequent discourse than any other NPs due 
to its highest degree of accessibility. 
Moreover, in Walker et al.&apos;s framework, topic 
NP is given two further advantages: they 
suggest (a) that a NP marked by &apos;wa&apos; becomes 
the backward-looking center even at the onset 
of the discourse; and (b) that once topic NP is 
realised as the backward-looking center ,as 
long as it continues to be realised as a zero 
pronoun in subsequent discourse, it could 
continue to be the backward-looking center. 
The second advantage given to the topic NP is 
called &apos;zero topic assignment&apos;, which is 
defined as in (7):
# Para 285 1
(7)Zero Topic Assignment (ZTA)
# Para 286 1
(optional)
# Para 287 5
When a zero in Ui+1 represents an entity 
that was Cb (Ui), and when no other 
CONTINUE transition is available, that 
zero may be interpreted as the ZERO 
TOPIC of Ui+1
# Para 292 5
Walker et al. demonstrate that their 
framework, including an optional rule of zero 
topic assignment, can successfully explain the 
preference in the interpretation of the last 
sentence in (8):
# Para 297 1

# Para 328 1
Cb2=Michiko
# Para 329 2
Cf2=(Michiko, lunch, Hanako) 
[S-SHIFT]from [3]-Cf2
# Para 331 4
According to the questionnaire carried out by 
Walker et al., the preferred interpretation of 
[4] is that Hanako invited Michiko to lunch. 
As you can see, in fact, there are two possible
# Para 335 1
ways of ranldng forward-looking center in [3],
# Para 336 7
and two possible ways of deciding both the 
backward-looking center and the ranking of 
forward-looking center in [4]. In their analysis 
of (8), the preference in the interpretation in 
[4] is explained by zero topic assignment in 
• [3] and preference on &apos;continue&apos; transition in 
[4].
# Para 343 11
In summary, Walker et al.&apos;s account of 
Japanese zero pronoun is based on two 
independent preference mechanisms: the first 
one is the forward center ranking, and the 
second is the ordered transition states. 
However, as Walker et al. themselves point 
out, each transition state between discourse 
segments is determined by the ordering of 
forward looking centers, the predictions of the 
theory tend to depend more largely on the 
forward center ranking.
# Para 354 1
3. Problems with Walker et al.
# Para 355 5
Now I would like to discuss some problems 
with Walker et al.&apos;s framework. Needless to 
say, it has great advantages, such as relative 
ease of computational implementation. 
Moreover, I agree that accessibility of
# Para 360 1
14
# Para 361 16
discourse entities plays an important role in 
reference assignment, and their forward center 
ranking is an adequate enough approximation 
of accessibility of discourse entities in 
different grammatical categories in Japanese. 
However, as I mentioned before, there are 
cases whose interpretation process cannot 
possibly be explained by the accessibility 
factor alone. Accounts of reference assignment 
which are largely based on accessibility of 
discourse entities tend to exhibit their 
weaknesses when they face cases which 
require some pragmatic inferences, and 
Walker et al. is not an exception here. I will 
illustrate two problems they need to solve 
below.
# Para 377 1
3.1. Multiple topics
# Para 378 14
One of the most obvious shortcomings of 
Walker et al. &apos;s approach is that it cannot 
handle situations where there is more than one 
topic in a sentence. In their framework, in 
order to identify zero pronouns, the backward- 
looking center has to be identified first. The 
backward-looking center, in turn, is 
determined by the way forward-looking 
centers are ranked. Therefore, the most 
powerful mechanism in their framework is the 
forward-looking center ranking shown in (5) 
above. However, notice that it is only useful if 
there is no more than one entity in each 
category in a sentence.
# Para 392 14
Let us concentrate on the category of topic 
here. In Walker et al. &apos;s framework, the topic 
matter `wa &apos; is given a special status: the topic 
marker `wa &apos; is so powerful that the topic NP 
becomes the most highly ranked forward- 
looking center even at the onset of a discourse; 
in addition, once a topic NP is realised as the 
backward-looking center, as long as it 
continues to be realised as zero pronoun in 
subsequent discourse, it could continue to be 
the backward-looking center. This status of the 
topic NP rightly allows the possibility of 
multiple topics as in (9), which is very often 
seen in Japanese discourse:
# Para 406 2
(9)(l] Mary to Jane wa shinyuu da. 
and TOP best friends are
# Para 408 2
&apos;Mary and Jane are each other&apos;s best 
friend.&apos;
# Para 410 3
[2]..Senshuu no Doyoubi, Mary wa kaze 
last week GEN Saturday TOP cold

# Para 413 1
ACC had lying-was
# Para 414 2
Last Saturday, Mary had a cold and 
was lying on the bed.&apos;
# Para 416 1

# Para 418 1

# Para 419 1

# Para 420 2
&apos;As always, Jane phoned (Mary) around 
noon.
# Para 422 1

# Para 423 3
film to invite planning to was 
`(She) was planning to invite (her) to a 
film.&apos;
# Para 426 15
However, cases of multiple topics cause a 
serious problem to Walker et al. Here, the 
preferred interpretation of [4] is that Jane was 
planning to invite Mary to a film. Walker et al. 
might explain this preference by saying that 
this is because &apos;Jane&apos; is the backward-looking 
center in [4]. According to their framework, 
however, the alternative interpretation, 
namely, that Mary was planning to invite Jane 
to a film, is equally accessible, since Mary&apos; 
could continue to be the backward-looking 
center in [4]. The problem is that in their 
current framework, Walker et al. do not 
provide any mechanism to choose one 
interpretation and discard the other.
# Para 441 15
There is another problem concerning 
multiplicity of entities with equal degree of 
accessibility. In Japanese, post-positional 
particles such as &apos;wa &apos; and &apos;ga &apos; shouldn &apos;t be 
used more than once in a sentence. Thus, you 
wouldn&apos;t come across sentences with two 
overtly marked topics or subjects. However, it 
is possible to have more than one NP with 
more or less equal salience in one sentence, for 
example, when two nouns, the first being a 
modifier and the second being the head noun, 
form a NP. A noun modifier is followed by a 
particle &apos;no 1, the Genitive Case particle. Some 
examples of NPs which contain noun 
modifiers are shown in (10):
# Para 456 1
15
# Para 457 1
(10)a. Mary no tomodachi
# Para 458 2
GEN friend 
&apos;Mary&apos;s friend&apos;
# Para 460 1
b. Niwa no ki
# Para 461 1
garden GEN tree
# Para 462 1
&apos;A tree in the garden&apos;
# Para 463 3
c. Tegami no henji 
letter GEN reply 
&apos;A reply to the letter&apos;
# Para 466 8
Here, the first noun in each NP is the modifier. 
The most typical relation exhibited between 
two nouns combined by the particle &apos;no&apos; is the 
&apos;possessive&apos; relation, as in (10a): However, the 
use of &apos;no&apos; is by no means restricted to that 
relation, as illustrated in (10b) and (10c). Now 
consider (11), which include a NP with this 
structure:
# Para 474 2

addressed to his wife)
# Para 476 1

# Para 501 1
In (11), &apos;one of the buttons of my coat&apos; is 
# Para 502 27
introduced in [1] as the subject of the sentence. 
What is important here is that- the NP 
introduces two conceptual entities, namely, a 
&apos;coat&apos; and a button which are equally 
accessible. The question is whether Walker et 
al. &apos;s framework can handle cases like (11). For 
[2], the preferred interpretation is that the 
speaker wants his wife to find and fix the 
button today. Walker et al. &apos;s system would 
successfully predict that the button is the 
backward-center. for [2] and [3]. However, for 
[4], the preferred interpretation is that the 
speaker will need his coat tomorrow, rather 
than the button. I do not see how Walker et al. 
can explain this. Example (12) causes exactly 
the same problem for them. Walker et al. 
would predict that the preferred interpretation 
should be that the key has gone. This 
obviously is the wrong prediction. The point .I 
would like to make here is that there are many 
cases in Japanese discourse where there is 
more than one roughly equally salient 
discourse entity in a sentence which 
subsequently become equally strong candidate 
referents for zero pronouns, and some 
mechanism of choosing the right one is 
needed.
# Para 529 16
3.2. Ordered preference of transition states 
Now I would like to move on to a different 
kind of problem, which concerns their ordered 
preference of transition states shown in (4). 
• Walker at al., as well as centering theorists in 
general, assume that when there are more than 
one possible overall interpretation available, 
the one which exhibits &apos;continue&apos; transition is 
preferred.. This is based on the assumption that 
maximally coherent segments are those that 
require less processing effort and the hearer 
will prefer an interpretation which requires 
less processing effort. However, it is not 
difficult to think of examples which go against 
their assumption. For example, look at (13) 
and (14):
# Para 545 3

Let us look at (13) rust. What interests me 
here is the interpretation of the zero pronoun 
in [3]. Notice that both [3a] and (3b) are 
equally acceptable in terms of factual 
plausibility. In such case, Walker et al. would 
predict that Pa], which exhibits a &apos;continue&apos; 
transition should be preferred. However, for 
some reason, the preferred interpretation for 
[3] is not [3a], but [3b]. Similarly, in (14), the 
preferred interpretation for [2] is definitely 
[2b]. However, Walker et al. predict that [2a] 
should be preferred. Obviously, their 
mechanism based on the accessibility of 
transition states makes wrong predictions. In 
the next section, I will consider why this is the 
case.

problems with Walker et al.
# Para 592 3
Sperber &amp; Wilson&apos;s relevance theory (Sperber 
&amp; Wilson 1986/95) inherits the Gricean 
assumption that the hearer&apos;s goal of verbal
# Para 595 12
understanding is to find an interpretation 
intended by the speaker. However, it differs 
from Gricean approach in two crucial points: it 
does not take the view that we have to follow 
maxims, nor the view that we have to -be co-
operative, to achieve successful 
communication. Sperber &amp; Wilson claim that 
what makes communication achievable at all 
is a fundamental mechanism built in our 
cognitive system, namely, the pursuit of 
relevance. This is expressed as the First, or 
Cognitive, Principle of Relevance:
# Para 607 1
(15)Cognitive Principle of Relevance
# Para 608 2
Human Cognition tends to be geared to the 
maximisation of relevance.
# Para 610 4
The notion of relevance is defined in terms 
cognitive effects, i.e. some changes in the 
belief system, and processing effort to obtain 
such effects:
# Para 614 1
(16)Relevance
# Para 615 2
a. The greater the cognitive effects, the greater 
the relevance;
# Para 617 2
b. The smaller the effort needed to achieve 
those effects, the greater the relevance.
# Para 619 16
Cognitive effects result from the interaction of 
new and old (or contextual) information in one 
of the following three ways: (a) combining 
wit]) -an existing assumption to yield 
contextual implications; (b) strengthening an 
existing assumption; (c) contradicting and 
eliminating an existing assumption; Processing 
effort is the mental effort needed to parse the 
utterance, decide what proposition and 
propositional attitude it was intended to 
express, access an appropriate context, and 
work out the contextual effects of the utterance 
in the context. When an utterance has more 
than one possible interpretation, the hearer 
should look for the one which satisfies the 
following conditions of optimal relevance:
# Para 635 1
(17)Optimal relevance
# Para 636 2
An utterance is optimally relevant to the hearer 
iff:
# Para 638 1
a. it is relevant enough to be worth the hearer&apos;s
# Para 639 1
17
# Para 640 1
processing effort;
# Para 641 2
b. it is the most relevant one compatible with 
the speaker&apos;s abilities and	preferences.
# Para 643 2
The Second, or Communicative Principle of 
Relevance, governs this search process:
# Para 645 3
(18)Communicative Principle of Relevance 
Every utterance communicates a presumption 
of its own optimal relevance.
# Para 648 4
The pursuit of optimally relevant interpretation 
suggests a pattern of comprehension procedure 
the hearer should follow, which can be spelled 
out as (19):
# Para 652 2
(19)Relevance-theoretic comprehension 
procedure
# Para 654 3
a. consider cognitive effects in their order 
of accessibility (i.e. follow a path of	least
effort);
# Para 657 2
b. stop when the expected level of relevance is 
achieved.
# Para 659 25
Now let me illustrate how this 
comprehension procedure should work for 
Japanese zero pronoun resolution illustrated in 
(11), (12), (13) and (14). In Matsui (1995, 
1998, also Wilson and Matsui 1998), I have 
developed the idea proposed by Wilson (1992) 
that in addition to the factor of accessibility of 
candidate referents, there is another important 
factor which affects the hearer&apos;s choice of 
referent, namely, accessibility of contextual 
assumptions. Accessibility of contextual 
assumptions becomes particularly crucial 
when there is more than one roughly equally 
accessible candidate referent, and it is the 
factor which is vital to solve problems with 
Walker et al.. In fact, the importance of 
contextual assumptions in reference resolution 
had been recognised before and various 
proposals were made as to how to retrieve the 
right context: some appeal to situationally 
partitioned knowledge (e.g. Sanford &amp; Garrod 
1981) and others are motivated by textual 
coherence (e.g. Hobbs 1979; Asher &amp; 
Lascarides 1993). The account pursued here is 
different from any existing accounts in that it 
# Para 684 10
claims that the selection of contextual 
assumptions is ordered in terms of both their 
accessibility and likeliness to contribute 
towards cognitive effects of the utterance. In 
other words, in relevance theory, it is assumed 
that these candidate referents are tested in 
parallel, with the one which gives quickest 
access to a context in which the utterance as a 
whole yields an acceptable overall 
interpretation being selected.
# Para 694 33
As a working hypothesis, let us assume that 
certain contextual assumptions are accessed by 
the hearer after the immediately preceding 
utterance is processed, during and after the 
current utterance is being processed. I have no 
specific claim here concerning what triggers 
the retrieval or the construction of certain 
contextual assumptions, and can go along with 
existing suggestions (e.g. it can be triggered by 
lexical information, or/and by situational 
knowledge). As the second working 
hypothesis, I would like to suggest that after 
having understood an utterance, the hearer 
tends to have, if not always, fairly accurate 
expectation as to what kind of cognitive 
effects he would like to obtain from the next 
utterance. Relevance theory predicts that when 
an utterance creates in the hearer an 
expectation for a specific cognitive effect to be 
achieved by the next utterance, other things 
being equal, the hearer is more likely to spend 
his processing effort to find an interpretation 
which can achieve such cognitive effect when 
interpreting the utterance. As a consequence, 
the candidate referent which is not the highest 
in the general accessibility ranking can 
become the most accessible to the hearer if the 
referent is expected to contribute to the 
interpretation he is looking for. In other words, 
relevance theory predicts the alteration of 
accessibility ranking of the candidate referents 
as a result of the pursuit of certain cognitive 
effects.
# Para 727 6
Consider examples (11) and (12) in the 
context discussed above. In (11), the utterance 
in [31 is a request to the wife to find and fix 
the missing button of the speaker&apos;s coat before 
tomorrow. Generally, if someone asks you to 
do something by certain time, there should be
# Para 733 1
18
# Para 734 26
a good reason for such a time limit, since the 
time limit in turn may create certain priority. 
Thus, it should be reasonable to assume that 
after hearing the utterance in [3], the question 
such as &apos;why do I have to do it today?&apos; or 
&apos;can &apos;t it wait a little while?&apos; occurred in the 
hearer &apos;s mind. If so, the utterance in [4] can 
readily be interpreted as the reason why he 
made such a request he wants to wear the coat 
on the following day. The referent is assigned 
automatically during the process of finding 
expected the cognitive effects. Of course, what 
he needs is the coat with the button fixed, and 
this interpretation is only possible with the 
overall interpretation in which the &apos;coat&apos;, 
rather than the &apos;button , is the referent of the 
zero pronoun. The first utterance in (12), on 
the other hand, seems to create different kind 
of expectation in the hearer. After hearing that 
the bicycle was left unlocked, the most likely 
question occurs to everyone&apos;s mind is &apos;what 
happened to the bicycle?&apos; We all know the 
likely consequence of the unlocked bicycle, 
and the hearer of (12) gets the expected 
contextual effects by interpreting the zero 
pronoun as the &apos;bicycle&apos;, rather than the &apos;key
# Para 760 23
In both (13) and (14), it is reasonably 
assumed that the hearer will have a why- 
question in his mind before hearing the final 
utterance. In the case of (13), the only possible 
reason why John could not confirm the time 
with Peter by phone was because Peter was 
not at home when John phoned, and the zero 
pronoun is resolved automatically in the 
process of obtaining this interpretation. I will 
look at (14) in more detail. The interpretation 
of (14) might be explained like this. After 
processing the first utterance, certain 
assumptions might become moderately 
accessible (but not necessarily at the conscious 
level) to the hearer: e.g. various assumptions 
about John and his boss, and more general 
assumptions about being ashamed of&apos;, e.g. 
that one must feel unhappy about such 
situation, or that one must have specific 
reasons for such feeling, etc. In this way, 
contextual assumptions might contribute to 
form the hearer&apos;s anticipation about the way 
subsequent utterances achieve relevance.
# Para 783 17
When the hearer interprets the second 
utterance in (14), further&quot; -assumptions related 
to the event described, such as that &apos;workers 
are encouraged to come to work early &apos;, or 
&apos;bosses like their workers to arrive before 
them&quot; etc., might become highly accessible. 
Such assumptions contribute to the hearer&apos;s 
search for the way the utterance could achieve 
cognitive effects. At the final stage of the 
interpretation process, the hearer finds the only 
way in which the second utterance in (14) 
might be intended to achieve relevance in a 
context created by the first - namely, as an 
explanation for why John cannot help feeling 
ashamed of himself in front of his boss - and 
the zero-pronouns are resolved automatically 
in the process.
# Para 800 32
Furthermore, notice that as a consequence 
of using the notion of accessibility of 
contextual assumptions, an ad hoc system such 
as the ordered preference in transition states in 
Walker et aL &apos;s account becomes automatically 
unnecessary. For example, our framework 
could easily accommodate cases such as (13) 
and (14), where the referent of a zero pronoun 
in the current discourse is not the same as that 
of a zero pronoun in the preceding discourse, 
as well as cases where the most accessible 
candidate referent indeed coincides with the 
referent chosen on the basis of the preferred 
overall interpretation. Recall that the ordered 
transition states is created on the basis of the 
assumption that the hearer prefers an 
interpretation which exhibits &apos;continue&apos; 
relation, because such an interpretation 
requires less processing effort. I suggest that 
this assumption is ultimately wrong for the 
following reason: the preferred interpretation 
by the hearer is the one which provides 
enough cognitive effects worth his processing 
effort, rather than the one which merely 
requires less processing effort. Walker et al. 
would predict that the preferred interpretation 
for the second sentence in (14) is that &apos;John 
always comes to his office earlier than his 
boss.&apos; The question we have to ask here is: 
how could this interpretation possibly achieve 
relevance? I cannot easily see how. Relevance 
theory predicts that such interpretation will
# Para 832 1
19
# Para 833 17
never be considered when there is an 
alternative interpretation accessible which 
achieves relevance, even if the latter might 
require more processing effort. Notice here 
that the relevance theory shares the view that 
the intended interpretation should be the most 
accessible one for the hearer. However, in the 
framework of relevance theory, it is 
accessibility of contextual assumptions, 
together with the accessibility of contextual 
referents, that determines the overall 
accessibility of an interpretation. In this way, 
the fact that the preferred interpretation of the 
second sentence in (14) is more accessible 
overall for most of us, than the alternative 
interpretation, is adequately explained in this 
framework.
# Para 850 1
S. Summary
# Para 851 18
In this paper, I have proposed a way of 
complementing centering theory from a 
relevance-theoretic perspective. I have 
suggested that a model of reference 
assignment which appeals to the expectation 
based on the accessibility of candidate 
referents such as centering theory should 
ultimately accommodate some mechanism of 
contextual selection and pointed out that the 
hearer&apos;s expectation of specific contextual 
effects (a type of forward inferences) should 
be taken advantage of in creating such a 
mechanism. Recently, Oberlander (1998) says 
that &apos;the key lesson from the work on pronoun 
generation and interpretation is that we must 
develop a more sophisticated view of 
&apos;expectation.&quot; I hope this paper makes some 
contribution towards that goal.
