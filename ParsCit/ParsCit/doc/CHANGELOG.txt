090625b 
- Updated documentation only. no change to executables
- Released on 30 September 2009

090625 (due to Minh-Thang Luong)
- Standardized and improved ParsHed model with line-level classification instead of token-level as previously.
- Add a post-processing module for ParsHed to normalize field data, e.g. authors, email, etc.
- Detailed changes are reflected as follows:
  * Added resources/parsHed - all parsHed-related including models (old models in resources/parsHed/archive), template file, and top frequent keyword files.
  * Added lib/ParsHed - similar architect as lib/ParsCit to modularizes and faciliates line-level training in ParsHed.
	lib/ParsHed/Tr2crf.pm: line-level CRF feature extractor
	lib/ParsHed/PostProcess.pm: post-processing of field data
  * Added bin/parsHed - all parsHed-related scripts (redo.parsHed.pl, and tr2crffpp_parsHed.pl).
    Includes parseXmlHeader.pl and convert2TokenLevel.pl used by redo.parsHed.pl to convert output from line to token-level.
  * Updated bin/headExtract.pl - to use the new model lib/ParsHed, as well as old model (with -tokenLevel flag).
  * Bug fixes in Citation.pm and Preprocess.pm (see doc/v090625-Artemy-issues.txt). Thanks to Artemy Kolchinsky for reporting these issues.
  * Reordered the CHANGELOG into descending chronological order. 
090625 (due to Min-Yen KAN)
- Deprecated and unified ParsHedClient.rb into ParsCitClient.rb
- Deprecated and unified ParsHedServer.rb into ParsCitServer.rb
- Added wsdl/forecite.wsdl which describes the ParsCit portion of the services
- Added bin/ParsCitClientWSDL.rb which demonstrates the use of forecite.wsdl

090316:
- Adds ParsHed module, updates to:
  * resources/ -  parsHed.*.model model files for binaries
  * doc/ - svm_headerparse.tagged.txt (from CiteSeer; 935 headers)
  * bin/ - headExtract.pl, phOutput2xml.pl, redo.parsCit.pl, redo.parsHed.pl
  * crfpp/traindata/ - parsHed.train.data (converted from svm_headerparse.tagged.txt)

  yet entirely integrated, still separate module).

081201:
