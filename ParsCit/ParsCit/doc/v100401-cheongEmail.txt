Dear Prof. Kan:

I have selected 10 papers (the last 10 papers when all 198 papers are
sorted by their names in ascending order) from ICONIP2009.  ParsCit is
able to extract 81 citations among these 10 papers.  However, 41 of them
suffer the little problem mentioned in my previous email.  In particular,
the extracted titles of the papers cited in 58640836.txt contains "et al."
instead of the initials of some author names.

Attached please find the 10 papers.  Hope this information helps your team
to improve ParsCit.

Best regards,
