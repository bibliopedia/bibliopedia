<CENTER><H1>ParsCit: An open-source CRF Reference String Parsing Package</H1></CENTER>

<P>This is the home page of the ParsCit project, which performs two
tasks: 1) reference string parsing, sometimes also called citation
parsing or citation extraction, and 2) logical structure parsing of
scienfific documents.  It is architected as a supervised machine
learning procedure that uses Conditional Random Fields as its learning
mechanism.  You can download the code below, parse strings online, or
send batch jobs to our web service.  The code contains both the
training data, feature generator and shell scripts to connect the
system to a web service (used on this web site).</P>

<P>Some definitions (thanks to Robert Dale for Citations and Reference
Strings):

<DL>

  <DT>Reference String:</DT><DD>A text string in the bibliography or
  reference section of a work, usually at the end of the document that
  refers to a unique document.  Usually occurs with other reference
  strings that point to other documents. May also appear as
  footnotes.</DD>

  <DT>Citation:</DT><DD>A text string (usually explicit) in the
  document body that points to a corresponding reference string at the
  end of the document.  Several citations may co-refer to a single
  reference string.</DD>

  <DT>Document Logical Structure:</DT><DD> A hierarchy of logical
  components, for example, titles, authors, affiliations, abstracts,
  sections, etc., according to (Mao, Rosenfeld &amp;
  Kanungo,2003). Our logical structure is more comprehensive,
  comprising not only header metadata and references, but also the
  logical structure of the internals of the document -- sections,
  subsections, figures, tables, equations, footnotes and
  captions. </DD>

</DL>

<P>This project deals with the problem of parsing the reference
strings and parsing the logical structure of a document.  The first
task is handled by a module with the project namesake, ParsCit, and
the second task by a separate module SectLabel.

<!-- FAQ ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A name="faq"></a><H2>FAQ</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>What platforms does ParsCit work on?</DT>
  <DD>ParsCit works on all major platforms: Windows, Linux and MacOS.
    The installation requires ruby and perl and the CRF++ embedded
    package also requires standard UNIX utilities like sed.  You
    should have a working knowledge of UNIX and some experience in
    installing UNIX tools.  Due to our time constraints, we may not be
    able answer your particular problems with installation.  Do let us
    know if there was something important that you had to do to get
    your particular download and installation working; we'll
    incorporate it into the Troubleshooting section below.</DD>
  <DT>What is the difference of SectLabel and previous ParsHed?</DT>
  <DD>SectLabel is a newly-developed module that further extends
     ParsHed in functionality. It not only classifies header metadata,
     but analyzes full documents to output the logical structure of
     the internals of the document -- sections, subsections, figures,
     tables, equations, footnotes and captions. <BR/> For compatibility
     issues, the ParsHed module is still retained in our source code
     and command line options.  </DD>
  <DT>What is the "genericHeader" in the output of SectLabel?</DT>
  <DD>Generic headers, such as introduction, methodology, and
     evaluation, represent generic purposes of different sections in a
     scholarly article.  We map all section names to generic ones
     (i.e., "5. Text Features" to "Methodology").  This promotes
     comparative viewing of sections with identical purpose across
     articles.  </DD>
  <DT>Why is there an option to input file in XML format? Which DTD
    should it follow?</DT>
  <DD>SectLabel is a robust logical document structure inference
    system that can handle both rich input (produced by OCR software
    such as font or spatial features) to boost recognition
    performance, but still be able to perform inference on
    impoverished input (plain text) with degraded
    performance. Currently, the XML input must be in the form of
    output from Nuance OmniPage (version 16)'s XML format, and hence,
    should follows the DTD by OmniPage.  Note: The ParsCit team is not
    affiliated with Nuance in any way nor does it endorse
    OmniPage.</DD>
  <DT> The OmniPage XML doesn't seem to be well-formed.  Is that OK?</DT>
  <DD> Yes. The sample "XML" provided in the links (for Demo 2) are
    actual outputs for a sequence of XML pages (one XML file per
    page).  If you use OmniPage to save an XML file for input to
    ParsCit, make sure to save individual pages as separate files,
    then concatenate them to send to ParsCit.  You may want to
    download the sample links for inspection (as they are
    concatenations of several XML files, your browser will likely
    complain about them not being well-formed.</DD>
  <DT> I ran Demos 1 and 2 with the default "all" settings, but sections
    don't seem to be detected.</DT>
  <DD> There's no problem.  The demo just hides the SectLabel output
    by default.  Click "Show SectLabel output" to reveal it.</DD>
</DL>

<!-- Troubleshooting ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A name="t"></a><H2>Troubleshooting</H2>

<P> A list of common problems with ParsCit.  If you find problems,
email the lead developer at &lt;kanmy@comp.nus.edu.sg&gt;.  Please use
the subject "[ParsCit]" to ensure that it reaches our attention.  If
you have hand-corrected tagged data that you don't mind providing us,
we can use that to further improve ParsCit's extracting capabilities.
Nevertheless, there are problems with the output occasionally.  Below
are some common problems people have encountered.

<DL>
  <DT>I tried downloading and running ParsCit but I get complaints
    about /bin/sed and crf not being found.  Help?</DT>
  <DD>Please read the INSTALL.txt directions.  You need to recompile
    CRF++ for your platform.  The paths included with the install are
    for our version, you need to recompile to have the paths point
    correctly.</DD>
  <DT>When running citeExtract.pl I get some errors complaining about the wrong ELF class of the binaries.  How can I fix this?</DT>
  <DD>This seems to be a problem with the compiled executables of CRF++ bundled with the software.  Follow the INSTALL instructions but after step 1 do:
<P>
<CODE>$ cp -Rf * ../../.libs
$ cp crf_learn ../../.libs/lt-crf_learn<BR/>
$ cp crf_test ../../.libs/lt-crf_test<BR/>
</CODE></DD>
  <DT>Issue numbers don't get extracted.</DT>
  <DD>We're looking into this.  The training data does not make a
    distinction about volume and issue number.  We'd like to fix that
    in a subsequent release.</DD>
  <DT>Separation of author names and publishing year fails</DT>

  <DD> In some reference data with non-standard sequences of
    first names and family names, e.g.
<pre>
  Baltes, Paul, Ursula Staudinger, Ulmann Lindenberger (1999): Lifespan
  psychology: theory and application of intellectual functioning; in:
  Annual Review of Psychology, 50, 471-507
</pre>
    ParsCit's post processing step may not detect and deal with these
    problems reliably.  We're working to fix these too. </DD>
  <DT>I passed ParsCit plain text output but in another, non-English
    language.  I didn't get good results or I got empty results.  Can
    you help? </DT>
  <DD>Aside from English, ParsCit can handle Italian and German to a
    limited extent, thanks to the multilingual training data.
    However, the demo web interface uploads non-ASCII (e.g., UTF-8 or
    UTF-16 data) as binary data and fails to execute ParsCit.
    However, if you download a copy of ParsCit, the libraries do work
    on such data.  Here's a <A
    HREF="humanities.test.out.xml">sample</A>. We'd love to help make
    a more universal model that can accommodate reference strings in
    other languages.  If you're willing to help contribute ground
    truth data, we love to hear from you!</DD>

  <DT>How about retraining ParsCit for another language/domain?</DT>
  <DD>You can put your supervised exemplar data into the same format
    as tagged_references.txt found in crfpp/traindata/.  Once you have
    this file you can generate the appropriate model for ParsCit, by
    using three commands (assumes you are in the crfpp/traindata
    directory):
       <P>
<CODE>$ ../../bin/tr2crfpp.pl tagged_references.txt > parsCit.train.data
<BR/>
$ ../crf_learn parsCit.template parsCit.train.data model
<BR/>
$ mv model ../../resources/parsCit.model
</CODE>
   <P>The first command creates the input feature file that crfpp uses
     from the training data.  The second creates the model using the
     crf_learn command.  You can then move the model file to the
     resources/ subdirectory where it can be utilized.  To replace the
     default model that comes with ParsCit, just execute the final
     command.  </DD>
  <DT> Can I retrain the package for a different set of tags if I
     change the tagset in the training data?</DT>
  <DD> Yes, you should be able to change the tagset to suit your
     dataset.  You can add, eliminate and change the tagset as you
     wish.  You need to retrain the parser system after creating your
     tag data.  For more details on the training process, see the
     documentation for CRF++, that is on the web at sourceforge.
     </DD>
  <DT>When retraining I get a "bad_alloc" error.  What gives?</DT>
  <DD>We're not entirely sure of this.  CRF training is quite memory
     intensive and running a large amount of training data tuples may
     cause the embedded CRF++ package to fail.  You can try with less
     training data, or try training on a machine with a larger amount
     of RAM.  </DD>
  <DT>Does the web service actually work? I can't seem to run it.</DT>
  <DD>Occasionally our school's networking staff changes the firewall
    settings, so the port for our group's web services may be blocked
    (port 4000 on host wing.comp.nus.edu.sg).  If you find you can't
    reach our services (they time out), please let us know.  </DD>
    <DT>I get funny errors with crf_test not being useful.  How do I
    fix this?</DT> <DD>The updated README.txt file in the 090625b
    distribution fixes this.  Basically you need to recompile CRF++
    0.51 and place the libraries and the executables in the proper
    place. See the README for details.</DD>
