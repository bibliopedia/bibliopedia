(n6) Benjamin Braude, in "The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods," William and Mary Quarterly 54 (1997), claims that the Travels is arguably "the most important single work for the study of the European conception of the Other in the late medieval-early modern period" (115).

(n7) C. W. R. D. Moseley, introduction to The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, trans. C. W. R. D. Moseley (London: Penguin, 1983), 10. This is not the edition of the Travels that I will cite.

(n8) There have been many relatively recent studies of Mandeville's representation of non-Europeans: Mary B. Campbell, The Witness and the Other World: Exotic European Travel Writing, 400-1600 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988); John Block Friedman, The Monstrous Races in Medieval Art and Thought (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981); Stephen Greenblatt, Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991); Kim F. Hall, Things of Darkness: Economies of Race and Gender in Early Modern England (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996); Iain Macleod Higgins, "Imagining Christendom and Jerusalem to Paradise: Asia in Mandeville's Travels," in Discovering New Worlds: Essays on Medieval Exploration and Imagination, ed. Scott D. Westrem (New York: Garland, 1991), 91-114, and Writing East: The "Travels' of Sir John Mandeville (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997); and Donald R. Howard, Writers and Pilgrims: Medieval Pilgrimage Narratives and Their Posterity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980).

(n9) At this point it is necessary to briefly justify the utility of discussing Mandeville without enclosing his name within quotation marks. As Ralph Hanna has observed, the debate over the existence of a real, historical Sir John Mandeville, English knight from St. Albans, "has stimulated the most substantial research on the Travels" ("Mandeville,' in Middle English Prose: A Critical Guide to Major Authors and Genres, ed. A. S. G. Edwards [New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1984], 121). In the 1950s, Malcolm Letts, in the introduction to his edition of the Travels, gave the last gasp of the search for the historical John Mandeville, summarizing the evidence for his existence and concluding that after dying in 1372, he was buried in Liege, France (Mandeville's Travels, Hakluyt Society Reprints, ser. 2, no. 101-2 [London: Hakluyt Society, 1953], xvii-xviii). Recently, scholarship on the Travels has focused more directly on the work, making little mention of the possible problem of authorship. Iain Higgins only briefly touches on the question of the historical author ("Imagining Christendom," 95-96), while Stephen Greenblatt wonders what effect a fictional Mandeville would have on the "spiritual exchange" the tale's narrator initiates (Marvelous Possessions, 33). At this point, then, the fictive nature of the Travels' narrator is widely accepted, and the narrator can be referred to simply as Mandeville, with the assumption that he is a fictional character similar to Gulliver or Crusoe in later travel fiction.

(n10) Mandeville's Travels, ed. Letts, 3-Unless otherwise noted, further parenthetical references to the Travels will be to page numbers from Letts's scholarly edition of the Egerton manuscript. In his Penguin edition of the Travels, Moseley persuasively argues for the Egerton manuscript's superiority for working on Mandeville (Travels of Sir John Mandeville, 38-39). For an opposing view, see Higgins, Writing East, who demonstrates the interesting ways in which the narrative can be read by using multiple editions.

(n13) Edward Said, Orientalism (New York: Vintage, 1979), 54. It is important to remember that Mandeville wrote the Travels before the great period of European colonial expansion. It may therefore seem inappropriately ahistorical to use the postcolonial criticism of Bhabha, Said, Spivak, and JanMohamed in opening up discussion of the text. However, the body of contemporary theory about the construction of the other, especially as this criticism engages questions of a culture looking anxiously beyond its familiar bounds, is still useful when it is not specific to events of the truly colonial period. In this case, although Said is interested in colonial texts, his comment still seems applicable to this moment in the Travels, especially given the colonial impulse Mandeville exhibits in the text's final section.

(n16) Friedman, Monstrous Races, 35. Kenneth R. Stow makes a similar point in his study of medieval Jews, Alienated Minority: The Jews of Medieval Latin Europe (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992). He suggests that thirteenth-century popes were tolerant of European Jews "because their negative evaluation created for them a niche in the Christian cosmic structure" (270). As I argue below, the Jews also figured as an absolute other.

(n19) In order to support the argument that Mandeville presents the East as a satirical mirror turned against Europe, lain Higgins wrongly argues that Mandeville ecumenically represents the monstrous races as potentially redeemable. For example, Higgins claims that the presentation of the king of the dog-headed race "reveals his great devotion in an almost Christian fashion" (Writing East, 146). However, although Mandeville presents some human races as pseudo-Christian, the truly monstrous races fall outside of salvation for their irrational and wrong-headed beliefs. Thus in the passage describing the dog-headed race, they are marginalized and discounted for their worship of an ox. As we shall see, the humans who inhabit other parts of the world embrace elements of Christianity while the monstrous races do not.

(n20) Although this passage is absent from the Bodleian manuscript (Rawl. D. 99) of the Travels edited by Malcolm Letts, which skips from the description of the substitution of Judas for Jesus on the cross to the Muslim conception of the Trinity, then back to the Muslim declaration that they "trowe in God, that made heuene and erthe and alle thing... that the daie of doom shal come... that alle the werkes that God made, and alle the wordes that he spak... by his holy prophetys... arn verray soth" (455), the Bodleian manuscript does contain the assertion absent in chapter 13 of the Egerton manuscript, that Mandeville will "telle of the bileeve of Sarazeyns that arn cristen in partie" (451,my emphasis), an admission similar to that made about the proximity of Christians and Muslim beliefs already quoted from the Egerton manuscript.

(n21) This is Donald Howard's point when he links Mandeville's technique to a precursor, Ricoldus de Monte Crucis, who first praises the Saracens because "they are prayerful ... revere God's name... and show brotherly love to one another" before he "excoriates their law" and goes about at length "denigrating their claims to prophecies and miracles" (Writers and Pilgrims, 32). More recently, Iain Higgins has claimed that the narrative is a version of a "peculiar religious community" both in its "attempt to relate [other religions] to their counterparts at home" and in its cultural "relativism" which aligns with popular belief that the "radically other... [was] still capable of salvation" ("Imagining Christendom," 93, 98). See also Mary B. Campbell's claim for the narrative's "spirit of toleration" (The Witness and the Other World, 156). Due to the toleration attributed to Mandeville's search for the inner, "natural" religion and virtue, the Travels is moved into the context of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century debates about the "salvation of the infidel."

(n22) Gerard Verbeke traces the patristic and medieval discussion of human dignity in general which culminated in the thirteenth century in a "battle between East and West ... [over] the integrity and freedom of the individual human being." He argues that Aquinas defeated the Eastern philosophy of human dependence, providing a justification for free will and individual responsibility ("A Medieval Debate between East and West about Human Dignity," in Proceedings of the Patristic, Medieval, and Renaissance Conference [Villanova: Augustinian Historical Institute, 1983], 15, 14).

(n23) James Muldoon, "The Nature of the Infidel: The Anthropology of Canon Lawyers," in Discovering New Worlds: Essays on Medieval Exploration and Imagination, ed. Scott D. Westrem, Garland Medieval Casebooks 3 (New York: Garland, 1991), 118. He concludes that papal edicts were highly effective in disseminating the belief in rational infidels, supplanting "the fantastic creatures described by Mandeville... [with] rational creatures... for whom Christ had suffered and died" (122).

Said shows the inconsistency of Dante's entry into the question of saving the infidel, since Mohammed deserves the same treatment as Averroes and the others, who cannot claim ignorance of Christianity as the classical Greeks who share Limbo with them may (Orientalism, 68).

(n26) Ibid., B.11.119-20. Frank Grady has argued that in the literature of the late fourteenth century, a space is opened by texts like Piers and "Mandeville's Travels... [in which] virtuous pagans speak in voices that we are asked to accept as their own." See his "Piers Plowman, St. Erkenwald, and the Rule of Exceptional Salvations," Yearbook of Langland Studies 6 (1992): 86.

(n34) It should be noted that no authentic Muslim voice appears in the text; rather, the Sultan's words are Mandeville's creation and serve his purpose. Thus in the Travels, as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has elsewhere concluded, "The subaltern cannot speak" ("Can the Subaltern Speak?" in Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture, ed. Cary Nelson and Lawrence Grossberg [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988], 308).

(n35) In fact, as Donald Howard writes, "The ideal [European] pilgrim would have traveled, as St. Bernard of Clairvaux is said to have done along the shores of Lake Leman, with his eyes upon the ground to shut out the glories of the world" (Writers and Pilgrims, 24).

(n37) Jenny Mezciems, "'Tis not to divert the Reader': Moral and Literary Determinants in Some Early Travel Narratives," Prose Studies 5 (1982): 3. Donald Howard also begins his analysis of the Travels by recognizing the satiric quality of travel narratives in general: "the traveler compares foreign lands with his own and must stop to think: the circumstance plants the seed of irony and satire" (Writers and Pilgrims, 53).

(n38) Although this part of the narrative is absent from the Bodleian manuscript, it is present in the metrical version of the Travels found in the Coventry Record Office manuscript (M. C. Seymour, ed., The Metrical Version of Mandeville's Travels, Early English Text Society 269 [London: Oxford University Press, 1973]); this is the edition I will cite hereafter for the metrical version. The narrative conflates (intentionally, Seymour suggests [ibid., 129 n. 2767]) the practices of Tibet with the euthanasia practiced in Sumatra, so that before his death, when a father is seriously ill, the son consults with the priests to determine if the father should live or die. If the father is not meant to live, his family "wille hym nyme / And vppon a bere fast bynden hyme" (2802-3) and take him up a mountain, and while he is still living, the "preeste to hym shal gone / And cutte of his heede anone" (2812-13). The killing included in this passage may thus have had an even more direct resonance with the structural similarities of the Eucharist as a ritual sacrifice and cannibalistic ritual.

(n42) Jews get very little treatment in most studies of Mandeville's Travels. Greenblatt provides one recent discussion of Mandeville's Jews, but he treats them only briefly in his chapter on the Travels (Marvelous Possessions, 50). Higgins deals more completely with Mandeville's treatment of Jews in Writing East, 178-85.

(n47) Stowe, Alienated Minority, 6.

(n48) Jews may have been imagined as killers of Christ in the present tense in Mandeville's Europe. As Joshua Trachtenberg reminds us, in the popular imagination Jews were believed to mutilate the transubstantiated Host, "the alleged motive behind these acts being apparently to vent their anti-Christian spleen once more upon the body of Christ" (The Devil and the Jews: The Medieval Conception of the Jews and Its Relation to Modern Antisemitism [New York: Meridian, 1961], 111).

(n49) Trachtenberg, The Devil and the Jews, 101.

(n50) The metrical version of the Travels provides even more anti-Semitic anxiety. It concludes that after escaping their confinement to serve the Antichrist, Gog and Magog "beleueth, bothe more and lasse, / Throuh alle the worlde that thei shal passe / And to hir bileve turne alle mankynde" (2243-45). Beliefs like these figure the Jews as the most significant threat to Western Christianity.
