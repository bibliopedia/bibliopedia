<abstract>We describe an approach to deriving efficient rules for interpreting the intended meaning of indirect speech acts. We have constructed a system called sally that starts with a few, very general principles for understanding the intention of the speaker of an utterance. After inferring the intended meaning of a particular utterance, sally creates a specialized rule to understand directly similar utterances in the future</abstract>
