----------------------------------------------------------------------
This software has been developed together at IST at Penn State
University and at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Current development (from 2008 onwards) has been done at NUS only.
The newer version of files are supported only through the newer
scripts written at NUS.

SectLabel has been developed at NUS (2010) to retrieve logical
structure of scientific documents. For further information, please
refer to the webpage description and TroubleShooting section.
