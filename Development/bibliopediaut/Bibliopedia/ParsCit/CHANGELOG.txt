- Major Change: Added SectLabel module (due to Minh-Thang Luong and
  Thuy Dung Nguyen)
- Added Iconip training data from Cheong Chi Hong
- Updated default model to include Iconip data
- Updated CGI demo to call new SectLabel module as well
- Updated documentation
- Corrected small regexp error in lib/ParsCit/PreProcess.pm
- Corrected small problem with training data in mixed-humanities

(by Thang)
- Added SectLabel (bin/sectExtract.pl, bin/sectExtract/, resource/sectExtract, lib/SectExtract)
- Modified bin/citeExtract.pl, lib/ParsCit/PostProcess.pm, lib/ParsHed/PostProcess.pm to combine ParsCit, ParsHed, SectLabel, and standardize XML output
- Added test/ for testing purpose with 12 samples documents and standard-output of citeExtract.pl in 5 modes (citations, header, section, meta, and all) using both txt and XML inputs
- Added SectLabel annotated data doc/sectLabel.tagged.txt and doc/sectLabelXml.tagged.txt (40 documents fully annotated)
- Added in crfpp/traindata CRF++ feature files (sectLabel.train.dataXml, sectLabel.train.data) and templates (sectLabel.templateXml, sectLabel.template)

- Incorporated works by Emma 
-- Added GenericSect code (bin/sectLabel/genericSectExtract.rb, crfpp/traindata/genericSect.train.data, bin/sectLabel/genericSect/) into SectLabel
-- Added GenericSect annotated data doc/genericSect.tagged.txt (211 documents with headers annotated)
-- Added in crfpp/traindata CRF++ feature file (genericSect.train.data) and template (genericSect.template)

090625b 
- Updated documentation only. no change to executables
- Released on 30 September 2009

090625 (due to Minh-Thang Luong)
- Standardized and improved ParsHed model with line-level
  classification instead of token-level as previously.
- Add a post-processing module for ParsHed to normalize field data,
  e.g. authors, email, etc.
- Detailed changes are reflected as follows:
  * Added resources/parsHed - all parsHed-related including models
   (old models in resources/parsHed/archive), template file, and
   top frequent keyword files.
  * Added lib/ParsHed - similar architect as lib/ParsCit to
    modularizes and faciliates line-level training in ParsHed.
	lib/ParsHed/Tr2crf.pm: line-level CRF feature extractor
	lib/ParsHed/PostProcess.pm: post-processing of field data
  * Added bin/parsHed - all parsHed-related scripts (redo.parsHed.pl,
    and tr2crffpp_parsHed.pl).  Includes parseXmlHeader.pl and
    convert2TokenLevel.pl used by redo.parsHed.pl to convert output
    from line to token-level.
  * Updated bin/headExtract.pl - to use the new model lib/ParsHed, as
    well as old model (with -tokenLevel flag).
  * Bug fixes in Citation.pm and Preprocess.pm (see
    doc/v090625-Artemy-issues.txt). Thanks to Artemy Kolchinsky for
    reporting these issues.
  * Reordered the CHANGELOG into descending chronological order. 
090625 (due to Min-Yen KAN)
- Deprecated and unified ParsHedClient.rb into ParsCitClient.rb
- Deprecated and unified ParsHedServer.rb into ParsCitServer.rb
- Added wsdl/forecite.wsdl which describes the ParsCit portion of the services
- Added bin/ParsCitClientWSDL.rb which demonstrates the use of forecite.wsdl

090316:
- Adds ParsHed module, updates to:
  * resources/ -  parsHed.*.model model files for binaries
  * doc/ - svm_headerparse.tagged.txt (from CiteSeer; 935 headers)
  * bin/ - headExtract.pl, phOutput2xml.pl, redo.parsCit.pl, redo.parsHed.pl
  * crfpp/traindata/ - parsHed.train.data (converted from svm_headerparse.tagged.txt)
  Changes doc/index.html, doc/parsCit.cgi to handle parsHed call (not
  yet entirely integrated, still separate module).

081201:
- Bug fixes from Scienstein.org team
  * Added context positions
  * Handle reference patterns such as [1-5]
  * Handles context references within same window
  * See doc/v081201-sciensteinEmail.txt for detailed notes
- Updated ParsCit.cgi to update for context position output

080917:
- Added new training data from Matteo Romanello
- Fixed Preprocess.pm bug (thanks to Dain Kaplan)
- Upgraded CRF++ model to 0.51 (now bundled with CRF++ source just in case it is no longer available on sourceforge)
- Added bin/redo.pl script to retrain model

080402:
- Added re-tagged data from FLUX-CiM
- Added conlleval.pl evaluation script
- Added output2xml.pl transformation script
- Corrected warning in parseRefString.pl (thanks to Ayeh Bandeh-Ahmadi)

080310:
- First released version to Peter Weiland
- Web services working for wing machines at NUS
